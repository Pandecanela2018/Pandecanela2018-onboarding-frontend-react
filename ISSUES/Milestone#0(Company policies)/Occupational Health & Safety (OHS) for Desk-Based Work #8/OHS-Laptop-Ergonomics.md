I adjusted my monitor height because it was too low and caused neck pain. I also adjusted my keyboard and mouse because they were too far from me and caused wrist pain.
I need to improve my back posture and do stretching exercises.
Moreover, I will use Focus Bear to build habits throughout the day and stay relaxed.
