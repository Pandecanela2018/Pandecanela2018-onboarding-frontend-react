-I experienced great teamwork at my university with my classmates, and it was effective because we had effective communication when we organized the project. In addition, each of us had responsibilities. When we had questions, we helped each other.

-i think, if you want to need a clear communication:

1-Investigate who this is intended for.
1-Organize your ideas.
2-Write it.
3- Explain your ideas.

-Organize small team meetings where we can all play games together and resolve a problem.

-I think a person is proactive when he shares good ideas to improve the app or the work and he does things without being told.

-if i must talk with my collleagues I will send a message on discord but if he doesn't answer, I will send email.

In other hand, If i must talk with my supervisor i will send email and i will wait to answer to me, But if it were an emergency, I would call them.

-I won’t discriminate or bully anyone.
